# wireles-location
creating a wirles location tracker for korfball
the hardware we are using is:
a Arduino (model undefined, can also be a bearbone arduino I have the posibility to make a PCB)
the wireles signal we are using can be a bluetooth shield or somthing else (bluetooth is good for the distance we must get (20M x 40M))

if there ar other suggentions please send me a PB so i can see if it is posible.
